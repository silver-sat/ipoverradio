Code / configuration for setting up a raspberry pi internet connection over a radio link

[IP over Serial](ipoverserial) describes the setup and configuration of the RPis to get a network connection over serial. Do this first.

[IP via Arduino](ipviaarduino) describes the setup and code to have the serial data for the network connection pass through an Arduino (which can add errors and delays to simulate radio transmission).
